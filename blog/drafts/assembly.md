has a power of 10 associated with it based on its position in the number.

234 = 2x10^2 + 3x10^1 + 4x10^0

#### Binary
Base 2 numbers are composed of 2 possible digits (0 and 1). Each digit of a number
has a power of 2 associated with it based on its position in the number.
(A single binary digit is called a bit.)
