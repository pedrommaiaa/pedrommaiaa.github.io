# Motivation 


The idea of making my own programming language might seems absurd 
for some people, after all, why someone would want to put so much effort
into making something that probably no one is going to use in the 
future?

My answer to that is, *curiosity*. There are two types of [motivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Types_of_motivation) 
that can drive a person to do something, Intrinsic and extrinsic.

*Intrinsic* motivation exists whithin the individual and is driven by
satisfying internal rewards, like doing something for it's own sake or to 
satisfy your own curiosity.

*Extrinsic* motivation exists outside the individual, it's when you do or use 
something as a tool to achieve a goal or obtain an external rewards, 
like money or fame.
