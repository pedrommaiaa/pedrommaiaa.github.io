                          <p>"Like many other forms of art, hacking was often misunderstood. The few
                          who got it formed an informal subculture that remained <strong>intensely focused
                          on learning and mastering their art</strong>. They believed that <strong>information should
                          be free</strong> and anything that stood in the way of that freedom should be circumvented. 
                          Such obstructions included authority figures, the bureaucracy of
                          college classes, and discrimination. In a sea of graduation-driven students,
                          <strong>this unofficial group of hackers defied conventional goals and instead pursued
                          knowledge itself.</strong> ... Age, race, gender, appearance, academic degrees, and social status were not
                          primary criteria for judging another’s worth—not because of a desire for
                          equality, but because of a desire to advance the emerging art of hacking.
                          The original hackers found splendor and elegance in the conventionally
                          dry sciences of math and electronics. <strong>They saw programming as a form of
                          artistic expression and the computer as an instrument of that art.</strong> Their desire
                          to dissect and understand wasn’t intended to demystify artistic endeavors; it
                          was simply a way to achieve a greater appreciation of them. These knowledge-driven 
                          values would eventually be called the Hacker Ethic: <strong>the appreciation
                          of logic as an art form and the promotion of the free flow of information,
                          surmounting conventional boundaries and restrictions for the simple goal of
                          better understanding the world.</strong> 
                          <br>
                          ...
                          <br>
                          The sciences of nuclear physics and biochemistry can be used to kill,
                          yet they also provide us with significant scientific advancement and modern
                          medicine. <strong>There’s nothing good or bad about knowledge itself; morality lies
                          in the application of knowledge.</strong> Even if we wanted to, we couldn’t suppress
                          the knowledge of how to convert matter into energy or stop the continued
                          technological progress of society. In the same way, <strong>the hacker spirit can
                          never be stopped</strong>, nor can it be easily categorized or dissected. Hackers will
                          constantly be pushing the limits of knowledge and acceptable behavior,
                          forcing us to explore further and further."
